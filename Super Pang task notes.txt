Trail Renderer for basic projectile

Change gameplay loop from time based to life based (Add UI for this as well)

Add character from unit 3 as player with their idle and move animations and death animation
  so basically add the character facing the world and when he dies rotate it 180 degreee and face the player before
  playing death animation

 make baloons only collide with player and stage boundary not with each other 
  Timestop Powerup
1. make the balls freeze and let the player pass through while allowing player to damage them
1.1 method should be 
{
   
    disable rigidbody . isgravity
	add a bool where damagePlayer is set to true allows the collsion to player 
	add a new script and new object 
	on object "clock" disable rigidbody of all 3 balls and set the bool of damage player to false for a set amount of time
	on 1 death do the above function but for longer time like 5 sec
	
  make balls fall faster
my logic is to have a global hidden value that will rise when a smallest is "popped" if > 60 increase speed of all balls by 10
and keep it going until 600?
add the level bar at the bottom showing this progress or just add the smallest popped count in UI

Pick up any BGM (maybe from unit 3)
